The plugin uses a shortcode that you can easily insert into your posts.
A sample shortcode for displaying 10 pressure cookers with description from Amazon.com would look like:

**[wpzon keywords="pressure cooker" sindex="Kitchen" listing="10" country="com" descr="1"]**


A sample shortcode for displaying 2 specific products based by their Asin number will look like:

**[wpzon spec="1" asin="B00006ISG6,B0000717AU" listing="2"]**
